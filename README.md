## User Story

AS A developer I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I may publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions


## Description

WHEN I open the live application
I am presented with the homepage and I am able to view existing blog posts if any have been posted.
I can view navigation links for the homepage and the dashboard and the option to log in
WHEN I click on any other links in the navigation
THEN I am prompted to either sign up or sign in
WHEN I sign up
THEN I am prompted to create a username and password
WHEN I click on the sign-up button
THEN my user credentials are saved and I am logged into the site
WHEN I revisit the site at a later time and choose to sign in
THEN I am prompted to sign in again with my username and password
WHEN I am signed in to the site
THEN I see navigation links for the homepage, the dashboard, and the option to log out
WHEN I click on an existing blog post
THEN I am presented with the post title, contents, post creatorâ€™s username, and date created for that post and have the option to leave a comment.
WHEN I enter a comment and click on the submit button while signed in
THEN the comment is saved and the post is updated to display the new data.
WHEN I click on the dashboard option in the navigation
THEN I am taken to the dashboard and presented with any blog posts I have already created and the option to add a new blog post
WHEN I click on the button to add a new blog post
THEN I am prompted to enter both a title and contents for my blog post and the title and contents of my post are saved and I am taken back to an updated dashboard with the new data.
WHEN I click on one of my existing posts in the dashboard
THEN I am able to delete or update my post.
WHEN I click on the logout option in the navigation
THEN I am signed out of the site.
